Word: [component](https://github.com/component/component) provides a delicious capacity to build a more tightly focused clientside.

====================

three.js - webgl renderer <br />

**NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CASUAL USE**

You will almost certainly find missing dependancies.

Reorganizing three.js into usable submodules is a large undertaking.

**And I certainly do not want to do it!**

But nor do I want large scripts constipating my pipes.

So, instead of attempting to do it all in one go, I've decided to go cherry picking.

* I will add only what I need.
* I will add it only when I need it. 
* I will attempt to organize into bite sized submodules as I go.
* I may discover that I walked down a blind alley and suddenly re-organize, backward **incompatibly**.
* I will properly tag versions, to combat the above.
* I may suddenly stop.
* I will never delete the repos.
* You may decide use this/these despite the above.
* You might even fork to fix a dependancy or two.
* Your fork may be valuable, so let me know.


### Dev
